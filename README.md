What This Code Is

This is a Python mini-project focused on conditionals (if–else).
It combines four small programs into a single file with a menu system.

1. Number Checker
	•	User enters a positive integer.
	•	Program checks:
	•	If it’s even or odd.
	•	If it’s prime or not.
	•	If it’s a perfect number or not.

2. Grading System
	•	User enters marks (0–100).
	•	Program outputs a grade A–F.
	•	Validates input so marks can’t be negative or more than 100.

3. ATM Program
	•	Simulates an ATM machine.
	•	Starts with a balance (1000 by default).
	•	Lets the user:
	•	Check balance.
	•	Deposit money.
	•	Withdraw money (only if enough balance).
	•	Exit.

4. Traffic Light Simulator
	•	User types a traffic light color (Red/Yellow/Green).
	•	Program prints the correct action:
	•	Green → Go
	•	Yellow → Wait
	•	Red → Stop
	•	Any other input = Invalid.

Structure of the Code
	•	Each task is written as its own function (so the code is clean and modular).
	•	A main menu lets the user pick which function to run.
	•	A while True loop keeps the program running until the user chooses Exit.
	•	Input validation is included (so wrong inputs don’t crash the program).
	•	It’s all in one file so you can run everything together, like your first project.

So in short:
This file is a Conditionals Practice Project — one Python script that demonstrates how to use if–else statements, comparisons, and logical operators by solving small problems, then tying them into a single menu-driven program.
